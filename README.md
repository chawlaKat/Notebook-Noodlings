# Notebook-Noodlings
A place to organize my Google Colab notebooks.

My most recent project is data visualization for aslib.net; I'm working with Dr. Lars Kotthoff at the University of Wyoming to creat dynamic graphs for .arff files. This will allow us to look for trends in algorithm selection data.

# How to Use
To read the notebooks: click on the file. GitHub will display the notebook within the browser.

To play with or run the code: 
- open the file in GitHub, then follow the link to Google Colaboratory
- choose any cell and run it. Colab will ask if you want to reset the runtime. check the box and choose "run anyway" (unless that would interfere with something you're already working on, in which case, do this in a private browser using a separate google account).
- if the notebook relies on external files, they'll be stored in this repo, in the "files" folder. clone it to your machine, then upload it to the Colab environment. You'll need to connect a google account to make this go.
