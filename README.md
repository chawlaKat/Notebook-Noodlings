# Notebook-Noodlings
A place to organize my Google Colab notebooks.

My most recent project is data visualization for aslib.net; I'm working with Dr. Lars Kotthoff at the University of Wyoming to creat dynamic graphs for .arff files. This will allow us to look for trends in algorithm selection data.

# How to Use
To read the notebooks: click on the file. GitHub will display the notebook within the browser. (Usually. It's been having trouble with the larger files.)

Alternately, navigate to Google Colaboratory, choose File > Open Notebook > GitHub, then search for chawlaKat/Notebook-Noodlings and then select the desired notebook. 

The third option is to clone this repo, choose File > Upload Notebook, and upload the desired .ipynb file. You must be signed into Google to do so. This will save the file to your Google Drive.

To play with or run the code: 
- open the notebook in Google Colaboratory
- if loading from GitHub, when you run the first cell, Colab may warn you to "Reset all runtimes before running". doing so starts the session fresh, but erases the state of any other Colab projects you have active. Generally, I leave this box checked (accepting the reset) and select "Run Anyway"
- if the notebook relies on external files, they'll be stored in this repo, in the "reference files" folder. clone this repo if you haven't already, then from the left sidebar go to Files > Upload in order to give the notebook access to these files. they will be erased at the end of the session.
