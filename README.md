# Notebook-Noodlings
A place to organize my Google Colab notebooks.

My most recent project is data visualization for aslib.net; I'm working with Dr. Lars Kotthoff at the University of Wyoming to creat dynamic graphs for .arff files. This will allow us to look for trends in algorithm selection data.

# What's what
Altair with Flair: working through altair tutorials (also, learning how to use colab)

Bark to Byte: moving data from a .arff file into a pandas dataframe

Pandas and corgis: working through pandas tutorials
