# Notebook-Noodlings
A place to organize my Google Colab notebooks.

My most recent project is data visualization for aslib.net; I'm working with Dr. Lars Kotthoff at the University of Wyoming to creat dynamic graphs for .arff files. This will allow us to look for trends in algorithm selection data.

# How to Use
To read the notebooks: click on the file. GitHub will display the notebook within the browser.

To play with or run the code: open the file in GitHub, then follow the link to Google Colaboratory. Any necessary files are listed at the top of the notebook, and stored in the "files" directory in this repo.

# What's what
Altair with Flair: working through altair tutorials (also, learning how to use colab)

Bark to Byte: moving data from a .arff file into a pandas dataframe

Pandas and corgis: working through pandas tutorials
